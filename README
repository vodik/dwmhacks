== dwm patches and hacks ==

 WARNING: Use these patches with extreme cation. With the compiling of these
 patches you are entering the edge of full-fledged fork territory. What started
 out as a collection of patches has ended up getting so intertwined and
 inseparable that one patch now may be adding several new features. I've also
 has issues managing all the associated config.h.def diffs so I've dropped them.

 SOME OF MY PATCHES WILL BREAK YOUR CODE - I DO NOT MAINTAIN ANY BACKWARDS
 COMPARABILITY

 Use these patches at your own risk. I use these regularity on a one and two
 monitor setup.

 cycle.c:
  - Adds the ability to cycles through the tagset one at a time. Allows you
    to pull the currency focused window along with you too.

 gaps.diff:
  - Adds gaps around the edges of windows correctly. Doesn't break on floating
    windows, doesn't add a double with gap in between windows. Can be enabled
    per layout.

 opacity.c, opacity.diff:
  - Makes unfocused windows shade. Allows for setting individual window
    transparency.

 pertag2.diff, nbstack.c:
  - Changes the tile arranger to a modified non-greedy ntile, adds pertag mfact,
    nmaster, and layouts, and the ability to configure individual pertag
    defaults. nbstack.c is a bstack variant of ntile.

 pidgin.c:
  - Special arranger for my chat tag. If it finds the contact list it puts it
    to the right of the mfact divide. All other windows are stacked
    horizontally in the remaining space.

 tagmon.diff:
  - Rereads Rules and retags a window if its moved between monitors.

 push.c:
  - As found here: http://dwm.suckless.org/patches/push. Here for archival
    purposes.

 config.diff:
  - Build dwm with the -O2 flag instead of the -Os flag.
