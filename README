== dwm patches and hacks ==

 WARNING: Use these patches with extreme cation. With the compiling of these
 patches you are entering the edge of full-fledged fork territory. What started
 out as a collection of patches has ended up getting so intertwined and
 inseparable that one patch now may be adding several new features. I've also
 has issues managing all the associated config.h.def diffs so I've dropped them.
